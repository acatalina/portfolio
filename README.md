# Portfolio website

This project was first initialized as part of a developer's pre-course exercise. Now it represents 
my portfolio website.

It has been built using HTML, vanilla CSS, Normalize, Materialize CSS and JQuery.

To explore the website, either clone this repository and just open index.html with your favourite browser or
visit it [here](https://acatalina.github.io/portfolio/)
